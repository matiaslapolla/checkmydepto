# CheckMyDepto

Welcome to the CheckMyDepto project! This project is a website designed to help users find apartments (referred to as "deptos" in the website). It provides various features such as authentication, data handling with CRUD capabilities, and a responsive user interface.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following technologies:

### ReactJS

ReactJS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of reusable UI components and provides a declarative approach to building interactive UIs.

### Material UI and Material UI Icons

Material UI is a popular React component library that follows the Material Design guidelines. It provides a set of pre-built components and styles that can be used to create a visually appealing and consistent user interface. Material UI Icons is an icon library that complements Material UI with a wide range of scalable vector icons.

### Supabase

Supabase is an open-source alternative to Firebase that provides a backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform. It offers a variety of services, including authentication, real-time data handling, and database management. Supabase simplifies the process of building serverless applications by providing a ready-to-use infrastructure.

## Getting Started

To get started with the CheckMyDepto project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository https://github.com/matiaslapolla/checkmydepto.git
2. Install dependencies: cd into the repository folder and execute npm install
3. Rename `.env.example` file to `.env`.
4. Edit the `.env` file and provide the necessary credentials for the remote backend (Supabase).
5. Start the development server: `npm start`
6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the website.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to express our gratitude to the developers and contributors of the technologies used in this project, including ReactJS, Material UI, Material UI Icons, and Supabase. Without their efforts, this project would not have been possible.


## Extra boilerplate info
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm start-edge`

Runs the app in the development mode on Microsoft Edge.\
You might modify this command in order to run the app on other browsers.\
This command is located in the package.json file, under the scripts section.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
