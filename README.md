# CheckMyDepto

Welcome to the CheckMyDepto project! This project is a website designed to help users find apartments (referred to as "deptos" in the website). 

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following technologies:

### ReactJS with React Router DOM

ReactJS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of reusable UI components and provides a declarative approach to building interactive UIs.

### Material UI and Material UI Icons

Material UI is a popular React component library that follows the Material Design guidelines. It provides a set of pre-built components and styles that can be used to create a visually appealing and consistent user interface. Material UI Icons is an icon library that complements Material UI with a wide range of scalable vector icons.

### Deployment

I decided to close this small project, so here is a deploy of the frontend side. https://checkmydepto.vercel.app/ - No backend stuff was done.
